# VoxelEngine
An attempt at making a Minecraft-Style voxel engine which focuses on easy extensibility.

The idea behind this project is to pretty much recreate Minecraft but with a focus on easy extensibility meaning it should be super straight forward to add your own blocks, entities and behaviors.
The engine currently supports adding custom blocks which can have custom models (.obj). The custom block's properties can be defined in an XML file (.vxl).
I'm planning on providing a C# modding API in the future so that users may create custom behavior such as world generation, block interaction and entities.

## Important
The textures used in this project are currently not my own. I'm using the Minecraft John Smith texturepack as a placeholder until I get around to making custom ones.
